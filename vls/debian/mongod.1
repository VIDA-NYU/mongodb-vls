.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmongod\fP is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB
system. It handles data requests, manages data format, and performs
background management operations.
.sp
This document provides a complete overview of all command line options
for \fBmongod\fP\&. These options are primarily useful for testing
purposes. In common operation, use the \fBconfiguration file
options\fP to control the behavior of
your database, which is fully capable of all operations described
below.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Core Options
.INDENT 0.0

.IP \(bu 2
connection closed events.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-port <port>
Specifies a TCP port for the \fBmongod\fP to listen for client
connections. By default \fBmongod\fP listens for connections on
port 27017.
.sp
UNIX\-like systems require root privileges to use ports with numbers
lower than 1024.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-bind_ip <ip address>
The IP address that the \fBmongod\fP process will bind to and
listen for connections. By default \fBmongod\fP listens for
connections all interfaces. You may attach \fBmongod\fP to any
interface; however, when attaching \fBmongod\fP to a publicly
accessible interface ensure that you have implemented proper
authentication and/or firewall restrictions to protect the
integrity of your database.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-maxConns <number>
Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous connections that
\fBmongod\fP will accept. This setting will have no effect if
it is higher than your operating system\(aqs configured maximum
connection tracking threshold.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-objcheck
Forces the \fBmongod\fP to validate all requests from clients
upon receipt to ensure that clients never insert invalid documents
into the database. For objects with a high degree of sub\-document
nesting, \fI\-\-objcheck\fP can have a small impact on
performance. You can set \fI\-\-noobjcheck\fP to disable object
checking at run\-time.
.sp
Changed in version 2.4: MongoDB enables \fI\-\-objcheck\fP by default, to prevent any
client from inserting malformed or invalid BSON into a MongoDB
database.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-noobjcheck
New in version 2.4.

.sp
Disables the default document validation that MongoDB performs on all
incoming BSON documents.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-logpath <path>
Specify a path for the log file that will hold all diagnostic
logging information.
.sp
Unless specified, \fBmongod\fP will output all log information
to the standard output. Additionally, unless you also specify
\fI\-\-logappend\fP, the logfile will be overwritten when the
process restarts.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
The behavior of the logging system may change in the near
future in response to the \fI\%SERVER-4499\fP case.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-logappend
When specified, this option ensures that \fBmongod\fP appends
new entries to the end of the logfile rather than overwriting the
content of the log when the process restarts.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-syslog
New in version 2.1.0.

.sp
Sends all logging output to the host\(aqs \fIsyslog\fP system rather
than to standard output or a log file as with \fI\-\-logpath\fP\&.
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
You cannot use \fI\-\-syslog\fP with \fI\-\-logpath\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-pidfilepath <path>
Specify a file location to hold the "\fIPID\fP" or process ID of
the \fBmongod\fP process. Useful for tracking the
\fBmongod\fP process in combination with the \fImongod \-\-fork\fP
option.
.sp
Without a specified \fI\-\-pidfilepath\fP option,
\fBmongos\fP creates no PID file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.B \-\-nounixsocket
Disables listening on the UNIX socket. \fBmongod\fP always
listens on the UNIX socket, unless \fI\-\-nounixsocket\fP is set,
\fI\-\-bind_ip\fP is \fInot\fP set, or \fI\-\-bind_ip\fP does \fInot\fP
specify \fB127.0.0.1\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-unixSocketPrefix <path>
Specifies a path for the UNIX socket. Unless this option has a
value \fBmongod\fP creates a socket with \fB/tmp\fP as a
prefix.
.sp
MongoDB will \fIalways\fP create and listen on a UNIX socket, unless
\fI\-\-nounixsocket\fP is set, \fI\-\-bind_ip\fP is \fInot\fP set,
or \fI\-\-bind_ip\fP does \fInot\fP specify \fB127.0.0.1\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-fork
Enables a \fIdaemon\fP mode for \fBmongod\fP that runs the
process to the background. This is the normal mode of operation, in
production and production\-like environments, but may \fInot\fP be
desirable for testing.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-auth
Enables database authentication for users connecting from remote
hosts. Configure users via the \fBmongo shell\fP\&. If no users exist, the localhost interface
will continue to have access to the database until the you create
the first user.
.sp
See the \fBSecurity and Authentication\fP
page for more information regarding this functionality.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-cpu
Forces \fBmongod\fP to report the percentage of CPU time in
write lock. \fBmongod\fP generates output every four
seconds. MongoDB writes this data to standard output or the logfile
if using the \fBlogpath\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dbpath <path>
Specify a directory for the \fBmongod\fP instance to store its
data. Typical locations include: \fB/srv/mongodb\fP,
\fB/var/lib/mongodb\fP or \fB/opt/mongodb\fP
.sp
Unless specified, \fBmongod\fP will look for data files in the
default \fB/data/db\fP directory. (Windows systems use the
\fB\edata\edb\fP directory.) If you installed using a package
management system. Check the \fB/etc/mongodb.conf\fP file provided by
your packages to see the configuration of the \fBdbpath\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-diaglog <value>
Creates a very verbose, \fIdiagnostic log\fP for troubleshooting
and recording various errors. MongoDB writes these log files in the
\fBdbpath\fP directory in a series of files that begin with
the string \fBdiaglog\fP and end with the initiation time of the
logging as a hex string.
.sp
The specified value configures the level of verbosity. Possible
values, and their impact are as follows.

You can use the \fBmongosniff\fP tool to replay this output
for investigation. Given a typical diaglog file, located at
\fB/data/db/diaglog.4f76a58c\fP, you might use a command in the
following form to read these files:
.INDENT 7.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fI\%--diaglog\fP is for internal use and not intended for most
users.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Setting the diagnostic level to \fB0\fP will cause \fBmongod\fP
to stop writing data to the \fIdiagnostic log\fP file. However,
the \fBmongod\fP instance will continue to keep the file open,
even if it is no longer writing data to the file.  If you want to
rename, move, or delete the diagnostic log you must cleanly shut
down the \fBmongod\fP instance before doing so.

.TP
.B \-\-directoryperdb
Alters the storage pattern of the data directory to store each
database\(aqs files in a distinct folder. This option will create
directories within the \fI\-\-dbpath\fP named for each directory.
.sp
Use this option in conjunction with your file system and device
configuration so that MongoDB will store data on a number of
distinct disk devices to increase write throughput or disk
capacity.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you have an existing \fBmongod\fP instance and
\fBdbpath\fP, and you want to enable
\fI\-\-directoryperdb\fP, you \fBmust\fP migrate your existing
databases to directories before setting \fI\-\-directoryperdb\fP
to access those databases.

64\-bit builds of versions after 2.0.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-journalOptions <arguments>
Provides functionality for testing. Not for general use, and may
affect database integrity.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-journalCommitInterval <value>
Specifies the maximum amount of time for \fBmongod\fP to allow
between journal operations. Possible values are between 2 and 300
milliseconds. Lower values increase the durability of the journal,
at the expense of disk performance.
.sp
The default journal commit interval is 100 milliseconds if a single
block device (e.g. physical volume, RAID device, or LVM volume)
contains both the journal and the data files.
.sp
If different block devices provide the journal and data files the
default journal commit interval is 30 milliseconds.
.sp
To force \fBmongod\fP to commit to the journal more frequently,
you can specify \fBj:true\fP\&. When a write operation with \fBj:true\fP
is pending, \fBmongod\fP will reduce
\fBjournalCommitInterval\fP to a third of the set value.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-ipv6
Specify this option to enable IPv6 support. This will allow clients

Runs a repair routine on all databases. This is equivalent
to shutting down and running the \fBrepairDatabase\fP database
command on all databases.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
During normal operations, only use the \fBrepairDatabase\fP
command and wrappers including \fBdb.repairDatabase()\fP in the
\fBmongo\fP shell and \fImongod \-\-repair\fP, to compact
database files and/or reclaim disk space. Be aware that these
operations remove and do not save any corrupt data during the
repair process.
.sp
If you are trying to repair a \fIreplica set\fP member, and you
have access to an intact copy of your data (e.g. a recent backup or
an intact member of the \fIreplica set\fP), you should restore
from that intact copy, and \fBnot\fP use \fBrepairDatabase\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Changed in version 2.1.2.

.sp
If you run the repair option \fIand\fP have data in a journal file,
\fBmongod\fP will refuse to start. In these cases you should
start \fBmongod\fP without the \fI\-\-repair\fP option to
allow \fBmongod\fP to recover data from the journal. This will
complete more quickly and will result in a more consistent and
complete data set.

\fIjournal\fP files from 1 gigabyte to 128 megabytes.
.sp
Use \fI\%--smallfiles\fP if you have a large number of databases

.TP
.B \-\-oplogSize <value>
Specifies a maximum size in megabytes for the replication operation
log (e.g. \fIoplog\fP\&.) By \fBmongod\fP creates an
\fIoplog\fP based on the maximum amount of space available. For
64\-bit systems, the op log is typically 5% of available disk space.
.sp
Once the \fBmongod\fP has created the oplog for the first
time, changing \fI\%--oplogSize\fP will not affect the size of
the oplog.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-fastsync
In the context of \fIreplica set\fP replication, set this option
if you have seeded this member with a snapshot of the
\fIdbpath\fP of another member of the set. Otherwise the
\fBmongod\fP will attempt to perform an initial sync,
as though the member were a new member.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the data is not perfectly synchronized \fIand\fP
\fBmongod\fP starts with \fBfastsync\fP, then the
secondary or slave will be permanently out of sync with the
primary, which may cause significant consistency problems.

.B \-\-replIndexPrefetch
New in version 2.2.

.sp
You must use \fI\%--replIndexPrefetch\fP in conjunction with
\fBreplSet\fP\&. The default value is \fBall\fP and available
options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnone\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBall\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_id_only\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default \fIsecondary\fP members of a \fIreplica set\fP will
load all indexes related to an operation into memory before
applying operations from the oplog. You can modify this behavior so
that the secondaries will only load the \fB_id\fP index. Specify
\fB_id_only\fP or \fBnone\fP to prevent the \fBmongod\fP from
loading \fIany\fP index into memory.
.UNINDENT
.SS Master\-Slave Replication
.sp
These options provide access to conventional master\-slave database
replication. While this functionality remains accessible in MongoDB,
replica sets are the preferred configuration for database replication.

.B \-\-master
Configures \fBmongod\fP to run as a replication
\fImaster\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

\fIslave\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-source <host><:port>
For use with the \fI\%--slave\fP option, the \fB\-\-source\fP option
designates the server that this instance will replicate.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-only <arg>
For use with the \fI\%--slave\fP option, the \fB\-\-only\fP option
specifies only a single \fIdatabase\fP to replicate.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-slavedelay <value>
For use with the \fI\%--slave\fP option, the \fB\-\-slavedelay\fP
option configures a "delay" in seconds, for this slave to wait to
apply operations from the \fImaster\fP node.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-autoresync
For use with the \fI\%--slave\fP option. When set,
\fI\%--autoresync\fP option allows this slave to automatically
resync if it is more than 10 seconds behind the master. This
setting may be problematic if the \fI\%--oplogSize\fP specifies
a too small oplog.
If the \fIoplog\fP is not large enough to store the difference in
changes between the master\(aqs current state and the state of the
slave, this instance will forcibly resync itself
unnecessarily. When you set the \fBautoresync\fP option to
\fBfalse\fP, the slave will not attempt an automatic resync more than
once in a ten minute period.
.UNINDENT
.SS Sharding Cluster Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-configsvr
Declares that this \fBmongod\fP instance serves as the
\fIconfig database\fP of a sharded cluster. When running with
this option, clients will not be able to write data to any database
other than \fBconfig\fP and \fBadmin\fP\&. The default port for a
\fBmongod\fP with this option is \fB27019\fP and the default
\fI\-\-dbpath\fP directory is \fB/data/configdb\fP, unless
specified.
.sp
Changed in version 2.2: \fI\%--configsvr\fP also sets \fI\%--smallfiles\fP\&.

.sp
Changed in version 2.4: \fI\%--configsvr\fP creates a local \fIoplog\fP\&.

.sp
Do not use \fI\%--configsvr\fP with \fI\%--replSet\fP or
\fI\%--shardsvr\fP\&. Config servers cannot be a shard
server or part of a \fIreplica set\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-shardsvr
Configures this \fBmongod\fP instance as a shard in a
partitioned cluster. The default port for these instances is
\fB27018\fP\&.  The only effect of \fI\%--shardsvr\fP is to change
the port number.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-moveParanoia
New in version 2.4.

.sp
During chunk migrations, \fI\%--moveParanoia\fP forces the
\fBmongod\fP instances to save all documents migrated from this
shard in the \fBmoveChunk\fP directory of the \fBdbpath\fP\&. MongoDB
does not delete data from this directory.
.sp
Prior to 2.4, \fI\%--moveParanoia\fP was the default behavior of
MongoDB.

all logging and reporting output.
.sp
Changed in version 2.4: \fI\%--sslPEMKeyPassword\fP is only needed when the private
key is encrypted. In earlier versions \fBmongod\fP would require
\fI\%--sslPEMKeyPassword\fP whenever using
\fI\%--sslOnNormalPorts\fP, even when the private key was not

Disables the requirement for SSL certificate validation, that
\fI\%--sslCAFile\fP enables. With
\fI\%--sslWeakCertificateValidation\fP, \fBmongod\fP will accept
connections if the client does not present a certificate when
establishing the connection.
